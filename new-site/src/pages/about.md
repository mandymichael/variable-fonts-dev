## Why?

This project was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mandy_kerr" target="_blank">Mandy Michael</a> to showcase the many possibilities and opportunities that variable fonts can offer developers and designers on the web. The aim is to provide developers with the resources and tools needed to use variable fonts in their own projects.

Variable fonts give us more control over our Typography-we can fine-tune the font characteristics to maximise the legibility, readability and overall accessibility of our website text. This is a level of control over our fonts that is unprecedented.

And to be perfectly honest, I just really like variable fonts, so I thought i'd share all the things I like doing with them, and maybe some stuff you might enjoy too!

Thank you,
