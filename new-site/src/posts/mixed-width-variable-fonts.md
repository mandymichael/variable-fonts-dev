A little while ago I was looking for a kooky font to make a text effect with and I came across Irregardless Variable which had mixed width characters. Turns out there are a few variable fonts with this characteristic, and this makes for some fun experiments and designs.

## Irregardless Variable, <span>By James T. Edmondson</span>

[Get Irregardless](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/irregardless) - Paid/Commercial

Seemed appropriate to start off with Irregardless given it was the first one I stumbled across. This font is made by the OhNo Type Co foundry (one of my favs). It has a feature setting that allows the use of different character set for certain characters and also have a light to black weight range.

I really like the quirkyness of the design and the big wide rounded letters!

## Bandeins Strange Variable, <span>By Maximilian MÃ¼sgens</span>

Bandeins Strange is the "strange" version of Bandeins Sans, it's width axis allows you to extend some glyphs to exaggerated widths. The above image demonstrates some of the character versions available in the font.

This font is great if you are looking for something a bit more geometric, and, in my opinion, is more suited to display, however in it's "normal" form it can be used as a body text.
