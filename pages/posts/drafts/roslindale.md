    cardFeaturedSummary: The flexibility of variable fonts enable developers to create more responsive designs and components that would have previously required  sacrifices. With variable fonts that contain a width axis, we can adjust the font-stretch property with CSS to condense the font. When we combine this with font-size  we can create more flexible response text on the web.

    <p>While re-building <a href="/">variablefonts.dev</a> I fell in love with <a href="https://djr.com/roslindale" target="_blank">Roslindale</a> by <a href="#" target="_blank">David Jonathon Ross</a>. The serifs and the range in weight and width. It was everything I loved about serif fonts, but just looked a bit fancier, and a bit funkier. So I made it the main heading for the site in the hope others would fall in love with it too.</p>

    </div>

<p className="roslindaleIntro">There are so many excellent variable fonts out there, but Roslindale's adaptability makes it a standout in practicality and usability without losing any character and charm. I knew I needed to shine a light on it's capability, so this is the first in a series of "font spotlights" where I feature my favourite Variable Fonts on the web.</p>

<div class="roslindaleQuote fullBleedSection">
<h3>Style</h3>
<blockquote>Roslindale is a serif typeface with sharp, stubby serifs, bulbous terminals, and the occasional hint of diagonal stress.”</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="roslindaleHistory fullBleedSection">
<p>The Roslindale family is inspired by De Vinne, an 1890s typeface from Central Type Foundry that was named after the renowned 19th-century printer.</p>

<div class="devinne fullBleedSection">
<img src="/images/post-assets/roslindale/devinne-specimen.jpg" alt="Right image, De Vinne Extended Roman Condensed and Extra Condensed American Type Founders 1897. Left Image: De Vinne in wood, from Bowne Printers, New York"  width="800" height="421" />

 <p>David encountered De Vinne for the first time in 2015 and was charmed by the clunkiness of the letters and intrigued by its condensed styles. He wondered if a typeface could be simple and ornate at the same time, and eventually, two years after his curiosity was piqued, DJR knew what his take on what his De Vinne should be.  </p>

 > To me, Roslindale is all about the contrast of sharp and blobby elements, from the knifelike tail of the 'R' to the bulbous terminal of the 'a'. That’s the thing I loved about De Vinne, the wonky Victorian typeface it is based on. And it is what I focused on distilling, as I let many of De Vinne’s other lumps and quirks fall by the wayside. <cite>David Jonathon Ross</cite>

<div class="designSpace fullBleedSection">
<p>Roslindale’s design space is combination of three things: <strong>optical size</strong>, <strong>width</strong>, and <strong>weight</strong>. You choose the size range and the typeface will control what weights and widths are available for that size.</p>
<p>To ensure that the typeface works at big and small sizes Roslindale has a focus on optimising the optical sizing to make sure it can maintain the balance between the utility of the font while maintaining the eccentricities.</p>

<div class="effectiveness fullBleedSection">
<p class="spaced">If you've done much with fonts on the web you'll appreciate how easy Roslindale is to work with/ It's flexible and the range of control for the weight and width will almost certainly cover whatever your requirements are.</p>
 
 <p class="spaced">Designed as a display font it works great for headings, but the wide range of optical sizes makes it workable for body copy as well. It feels rare, at least in my experience, to have such a beautifully designed font be so usable and flexible.</p>

 <p class="spaced">Roslindale is a versatile font without many limitations, David has designed something that is not only great for the web, but also your print and other design requirements. </p>
