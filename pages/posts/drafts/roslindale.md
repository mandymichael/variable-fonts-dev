    cardFeaturedSummary: The flexibility of variable fonts enable developers to create more responsive designs and components that would have previously required  sacrifices. With variable fonts that contain a width axis, we can adjust the font-stretch property with CSS to condense the font. When we combine this with font-size  we can create more flexible response text on the web.

While re-building this site I fell in love with Roslindale by David Jonathon Ross, the first time I saw it I loved the shapes, the character - it had everything I loved about serif fonts, but just looked a bit fancier, and a bit funkier. So I made it the main heading so you could experience it in all it's glory.

There are many great variable fonts out there so I wanted to take the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the ones I particularly like. So naturally Roslindale had to be the first one.

"Roslindale is a serif typeface with sharp, stubby serifs, bulbous terminals, and the occasional hint of diagonal stress."
