    cardFeaturedSummary: The flexibility of variable fonts enable developers to create more responsive designs and components that would have previously required  sacrifices. With variable fonts that contain a width axis, we can adjust the font-stretch property with CSS to condense the font. When we combine this with font-size  we can create more flexible response text on the web.

When thinking about what to include on variablefonts.dev I wanted to focus on demos and lists of fonts to help people find what they need. But while re-building the site I fell in love with Roslindale by David Jonathon Ross so I made it the main heading font so you could experience it in all it's glory.

I came to the realisation that I needed some way to shine a spotlight on specific fonts that I love. There are many great variable fonts out there, but for me there are some that instantly stand out and they deserve to have focus. So naturally Roslindale had to be the first one.

"Roslindale is a serif typeface with sharp, stubby serifs, bulbous terminals, and the occasional hint of diagonal stress."
